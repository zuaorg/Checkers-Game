# Checkers-Game
# For the CS-100 course I designed a checkers game on C++ as the final project. 
# This game, although pretty much barebone, satisfied all the functionality of the game. 
# The game was designed such that two players could play against each other, no wrong moves were allowed, a tally of the score was constantly updated and special attention was paid to ensure the game was intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.
